# TROUBLESHOOTING.md

[Polska wersja](TROUBLESHOOTING_PL.md)

Symptom-based troubleshooting for `wmbus_radio`.

## Golden rule

Read diagnostics in this order:

1. `boot`
2. `summary`
3. `meter_window`
4. `dropped` / `truncated`
5. `rx_path`
6. `suggestion`
7. `busy_ether_changed`

If you skip `meter_window`, you can fool yourself. If you skip `suggestion` and `busy_ether_changed`, you can also miss what the repo is already telling you about why SX1276 changed behaviour.

## 1. `summary` looks good, but the meter is still missing packets

Most likely causes:

- `SX1276` is dropping bad starts before decode,
- busy RF environment,
- `both` scheduling overhead,
- the meter is fast enough that misses are visible only in per-meter statistics.

What to check:

- `meter_window.win_avg_interval_s`
- `meter_window.count_window`
- `summary.total` vs your expected meter interval
- whether you are using `listen_mode: both`

Practical conclusion:

A clean `summary` does **not** prove good real reception. Trust `meter_window` first.

## 2. `drop_pct` is low, but real results are bad

Most likely on `SX1276` with `adaptive`.

What it usually means:

- losses happen before decode,
- rejected starts never entered `summary.total`,
- the radio is cleaner on paper than in reality.

What to do:

- look at `meter_window`,
- compare with `listen_mode: t1` instead of `both`,
- keep `sx1276_busy_ether_mode: adaptive` unless you have evidence the environment is calm.

## 3. `meter_window.win_avg_interval_s` is much larger than expected

This is one of the strongest signs of real packet loss.

Example:

- meter should transmit every `30 s`,
- `win_avg_interval_s` is around `90 s`.

That means you are receiving only about one third of expected packets.

Most likely causes:

- frequent collisions,
- busy RF,
- `both` overhead,
- `SX1276` limit under time pressure.

## 4. Many `false_start_like`, `probe_start_aborted`, or `preamble_read_failed`

Most likely causes:

- busy ether,
- weak overlapping traffic,
- distant meters,
- apartment-block noise,
- `SX1276` working close to its practical limit.

What to do:

- on `SX1276`, start with `adaptive`,
- avoid `both` unless necessary,
- focus on `meter_window` for highlighted meters,
- compare day vs night.

## 5. High `dll_crc_failed` with decent RSSI

This usually points to:

- overload,
- multipath,
- local interference,
- not simply “weak signal”.

What to check:

- `summary.avg_ok_rssi`
- `summary.avg_drop_rssi`
- `dropped.stage`
- antenna placement and local RF noise sources

## 6. `truncated` is high

This usually means the frame tail is not being read cleanly.

Possible causes:

- collisions near frame end,
- FIFO / RX pressure,
- weak signal tail,
- heavy time pressure in a busy environment.

What to check:

- `truncated` events with `want`, `got`, `raw_got`,
- whether the issue is specific to one large/frequent meter,
- whether the issue worsens during the day.

## 7. `both` works, but T1 got much worse

That is expected in many real environments.

Why:

- `both` adds switching overhead even when actual C1 traffic is low,
- the cost is especially painful on `SX1276`.

What to do:

- first compare with `listen_mode: t1`,
- if you need reliable mixed mode, use two devices,
- on one device, prefer `SX1262` over `SX1276`.

## 8. Which `sx1276_busy_ether_mode` should I use?

Start here:

```yaml
sx1276_busy_ether_mode: adaptive
```

Stay on `adaptive` if:

- you live in an apartment block,
- you see many false starts,
- `meter_window` is worse than `summary` suggests,
- you do not yet know how calm the environment is.

Try `normal` only if:

- you have few meters,
- the RF environment is calm,
- `meter_window` already looks stable.

Treat `aggressive` as a deliberate test setting, not a default.

## 9. I need a sane diagnostic profile

Typical safe profile:

```yaml
listen_mode: t1
diagnostic_mode: normal
highlight_meters:
  - "12345678"

# Optional, only if you need detailed events limited to highlight_meters:
# diagnostic_events_highlight_only: true

# SX1276 only:
sx1276_busy_ether_mode: adaptive
```

## 10. The shortest decision path

- use `SX1262` if reliability matters,
- use `SX1276` only when the environment is easier or the traffic is slower,
- do not trust `summary` alone,
- for mixed T1/C1 environments, two dedicated devices beat one `both` setup.
