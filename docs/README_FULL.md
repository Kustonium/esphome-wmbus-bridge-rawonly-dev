# ESPHome wM-Bus Bridge RAW-only

[Polska wersja](README_FULL_PL.md)

RAW-only wireless M-Bus radio bridge for ESPHome.

The ESP receives and validates wM-Bus telegrams, then publishes validated RAW HEX to MQTT. Meter decoding stays outside the ESP, for example in Home Assistant / Linux / `wmbusmeters`.

```text
meter -> SX1262/SX1276/CC1101/LR1121 -> ESPHome wmbus_radio -> MQTT HEX -> wmbusmeters / Home Assistant
```

## Start here

New user? Start with [`START_HERE.md`](START_HERE.md). It gives the recommended reading order and explains which file to open first.

## Design rule

The ESP is a radio bridge, not a meter decoder.

It does not:
- select `wmbusmeters` drivers,
- decrypt AES payloads,
- create meter value sensors,
- replace `wmbusmeters`.

It does:
- receive T1/C1 frames and experimental S1 frames,
- validate/normalize telegrams,
- publish valid telegram HEX to MQTT,
- publish RF diagnostics.

## MQTT topic scheme

The recommended topic scheme is:

```text
wmbus/<device>/telegram
wmbus/<device>/rssi/<meter_id>      # only with publish_rssi: true (default: false)
wmbus/<device>/diag/summary
wmbus/<device>/diag/summary_15min
wmbus/<device>/diag/meter_snapshot
wmbus/<device>/diag/boot
wmbus/<device>/diag/config
```

The Home Assistant bridge add-on should subscribe to:

```text
wmbus/+/telegram
```

Do not manually build topic paths in normal YAML. Use `topic_name`, or omit it and let the component use `esphome.name`.

```yaml
wmbus_radio:
  topic_name: "xiao_s3"
```

This generates:

```text
wmbus/xiao_s3/telegram
wmbus/xiao_s3/diag/...
```

If `topic_name` is omitted, `esphome.name` is used. `friendly_name` is not used for topics because it may contain spaces, uppercase characters or non-ASCII characters.

`topic_name` accepts only letters, digits, `_` and `-`. Do not include `wmbus/`, `/`, `+`, `#` or spaces.

Legacy manual overrides still work:

```yaml
telegram_topic: "..."
diagnostic_topic: "..."
```

but they are intended only for compatibility and produce a bilingual warning.

## Forwarding whitelist

By default every frame that decodes and passes the DLL CRC is published to
`wmbus/<device>/telegram`. In a dense block that is mostly neighbours' meters. Use
`forward_meters` to publish only your own:

```yaml
wmbus_radio:
  forward_meters:
    - 41551279
    - 90830781
```

If the same meters are already listed in `highlight_meters`, do not repeat them —
`true` reuses that list:

```yaml
wmbus_radio:
  highlight_meters:
    - 41551279
    - 90830781
  forward_meters: true
```

An empty list (the default) or `false` forwards everything, so existing configurations
are unaffected.

Notes:

- `forward_meters: true` with an empty `highlight_meters` does **not** silence the
  stream. Filtering stays off and a warning is printed at boot, because a filter
  matching an empty list would drop every frame.
- The boot log prints the parsed IDs and whether they came from `highlight_meters`;
  `dump_config()` reports the state as `Forward whitelist:`.

- The filter runs after decoding and DLL CRC, so it matches an ID the parser has
  already validated. Filtering on the raw header would be cheaper in theory but
  unreliable: an ID read from a frame that failed CRC can be corrupted.
- Use the ID exactly as the log prints it. A decimal `id:41551279` is written
  `- 41551279`; a meter whose A-field is not BCD prints as hex (`id:417F0666`, typical
  of Diehl/IZAR) and is written `- "0x417F0666"`. Both forms are matched.
- **Quote hex entries.** Unquoted, YAML resolves `0x417F0666` to the number
  `1098843750`, which would be stored as a decimal ID and never match. That case is
  caught at compile time with the quoted form spelled out, rather than failing silently.
- You do not have to know which kind a meter is. A non-BCD A-field always contains a
  nibble above 9, so its printed form always carries a hex letter, while a BCD ID never
  does — an all-digits entry means decimal, anything with letters means raw. The `0x`
  form also works for BCD meters (`"0x00088888"` is meter `89907`).
- Diagnostics are unaffected: counters and RSSI statistics are updated before
  publishing, so summaries still cover the whole ether including neighbours. Only the
  RAW stream is reduced.
- `target_meter_id` has its own topic and is deliberately not subject to the whitelist.

## Quick start

Clean minimal example:

```yaml
substitutions:
  devicename: esphome-wmbus-xiao-s3
  friendly_name: "wMBus Bridge XIAO S3"

esphome:
  name: ${devicename}
  friendly_name: ${friendly_name}

external_components:
  - source: github://Kustonium/esphome-wmbus-bridge-rawonly@main
    components: [wmbus_radio]
    refresh: 0s

wmbus_radio:
  radio_type: SX1262
  listen_mode: t1

  # Optional. If omitted, esphome.name is used.
  # topic_name: "${devicename}"

  diagnostic_mode: normal

  # Optional. In diagnostic_mode: normal this enables meter_snapshot
  # for these meters.
  highlight_meters:
    - "12345678"
    - "11335577"
    - "22446688"

  # ... SPI/radio pins go here ...
```

## Listen modes and frequency

`listen_mode` selects one RF profile for the receiver:

| `listen_mode` | Meaning | Default frequency |
|---|---|---:|
| `t1` | T1 only | `868.950 MHz` |
| `c1` | C1 only | `868.950 MHz` |
| `both` | T1/C1 only | `868.950 MHz` |
| `s1` | experimental S1 only | `868.300 MHz` |

`both` means **T1/C1 only**. S1 is a separate receive mode and cannot be combined with T1/C1 in one receiver configuration.

For normal T1/C1 use, `frequency:` can usually be omitted. For S1, the default is `868.300 MHz`, but it can be overridden for compatibility tests, for example:

```yaml
wmbus_radio:
  radio_type: SX1262
  listen_mode: s1
  frequency: 868.36
```

If an S1 telegram is received and passes validation, the component publishes it to MQTT the same way as T1/C1 telegrams. Meter-value decoding still happens outside the ESP, for example in `wmbusmeters`, and may require the correct driver and key. Proprietary or polling-based systems may not produce standard passive S1 telegrams.

## Diagnostic modes

Use presets, not a pile of individual flags:

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `off` | no MQTT diagnostics |
| `low` | global `summary` + hint |
| `normal` | `summary` + `summary_15min` + `meter_snapshot` for `highlight_meters` |
| `debug` | `normal` + drop/RX-path events |
| `dev` | full developer diagnostics, including raw/debug payloads |

Old modes remain accepted as deprecated aliases:
- `medium` -> `normal`
- `full` -> `dev`
- `raw` -> `dev`

Old detailed options such as `diagnostic_publish_summary_highlight_meters` and `diagnostic_publish_highlight_only` still compile for compatibility, but they are deprecated/advanced. Use the presets first.

`diagnostic_publish_highlight_only` was a confusing name. It filters detailed diagnostic events to `highlight_meters`; it does not enable meter statistics. The clearer name is:

```yaml
diagnostic_events_highlight_only: true
```

## Per-meter statistics

For normal use:

```yaml
diagnostic_mode: normal
highlight_meters:
  - "00088888"
  - "03500001"
```

This publishes a combined snapshot on:

```text
wmbus/<device>/diag/meter_snapshot
```

For advanced use:

```yaml
diagnostic_meter_stats: highlighted
```

or:

```yaml
diagnostic_meter_stats: all
```

Use `all` only for development or controlled testing in dense RF environments.

## Advanced / dev-only options

A few options exist for advanced or development workflows. They are not needed for normal use. See [`CONFIG_REFERENCE_MINIMAL.md`](CONFIG_REFERENCE_MINIMAL.md) for the full reference table.

- `target_meter_id` — if set, frames from this single meter ID are routed to a separate path (used together with `target_topic` / `target_log`).
- `target_topic` — alternative MQTT topic for the meter selected by `target_meter_id`.
- `target_log` — when `true`, target-meter hits are logged on the device.
- `publish_radio_raw` — dev-only raw radio tap published to a fixed topic `wmbus_bridge/raw`. This is not the normal validated telegram stream and should not be enabled in production.

## `listen_mode_filter_after_parse`

Default:

```yaml
listen_mode_filter_after_parse: false
```

This is the conservative/stable behavior. It is recommended when meters are nearby and reception is already good.

Experimental mode:

```yaml
listen_mode_filter_after_parse: true
```

This filters `listen_mode` after frame parsing/CRC/fallback has determined the final T1/C1 mode. It may help when meters are farther away, behind walls, or when frames are partially lost.

It may also increase:
- `false_start_like`,
- `payload_size_unknown`,
- `t1_decode3of6` drops.

Compare this option using `meter_snapshot` for the meters that matter, not only global `drop_pct`.

## Radio notes

- SX1262 is preferred for dense RF, frequent packets and long T1 frames.
- SX1276 can work well, especially in T1-only and quieter environments.
- For mixed T1/C1 environments, two dedicated receivers are usually better than one receiver in `both`.

`busy_ether_state` is SX1276-only. For SX1262, CC1101 and LR1121 it is reported as:

```json
"busy_ether_state": "n/a"
```

## CC1101

CC1101 support is available in the component, but it is still experimental. It requires explicit YAML opt-in and proper GDO0/GDO2 wiring.

## LR1121

LR1121 support is experimental too. It requires `lr1121_allow_experimental: true`,
a `busy_pin`, and on the Waveshare HF board `tcxo_voltage: 3.0v` plus
`payload_length: 255`. It has decoded T1, C1 and S1 on that board. See
[`CHIP_SELECTION.md`](CHIP_SELECTION.md) for where it stands against the others,
and [`RADIO_OPTIONS_MINIMAL.md`](RADIO_OPTIONS_MINIMAL.md) for the wiring.

## Support rule

No logs, no support.

Before asking for help provide:
- YAML without secrets,
- full boot log,
- 2-5 minutes of runtime log,
- radio module and ESP board model,
- wiring photo if using an external radio.
