// resource package and the board schematic, with no board on the desk. A driver

// T3S3 that works today, so the whole translation unit is empty unless a config
// actually selects radio_type: LR1121 (__init__.py adds the build flag then).
//
// Remove the gate once the driver has received a frame from a real meter. Until
// then it is the difference between "new radio available for testing" and

// which fills the field even for a shield declared has_tcxo = false), while the
// Meshtastic variant in the same package sets 1.8 V (a file whose own comments
// mention a different board). Neither is a measurement of the part fitted here,
// and the schematic labels Y2 only as "SMD TCXO 32 MHz (2.0x1.6)".

// Failure is asymmetric, which decides the default: too little voltage and the
// oscillator simply does not start, which the chip reports as HF_XOSC_START in
// GetErrors and setup() logs loudly. Too much and it starts anyway, out of
// spec, silently. So the default here is the LOW one - a boot that fails

// LR1121 - receive-only wM-Bus front end.
//
// Shape of the driver follows SX1262: buffer-based radio, one IRQ line, a BUSY
// handshake, and a read() that serves bytes out of a buffer loaded once per
// frame. What differs from SX126x and is worth knowing before editing:
//
//   * Opcodes are 16-bit, big-endian, and every command starts with them.
//   * A read is TWO SPI transactions, not one. Command goes out, CS rises,
//     BUSY must fall again, and only then does a second transaction clock out
//     one status byte followed by the payload. Doing it in a single transaction
//     returns stale bytes. (Semtech lr11xx_hal.c, verified against the copy in
//     the Waveshare package.)
//   * The RF switch is not a pin this driver toggles. DIO5/DIO6 drive an
//     external SPDT (RTC6603SP on the Waveshare board) and the chip sequences
//     them itself once SetDioAsRfSwitch has been given the table.
//
// wM-Bus specifics that are not negotiable and are therefore not options:
//   * DC-free (whitening) OFF. The chip default would scramble the payload.
//   * CRC OFF. wM-Bus carries its own per-block CRC; hardware CRC here would
//     reject good frames.
//   * Fixed packet length. In T-mode the L field is itself 3-out-of-6 encoded,
//     so the packet engine cannot read a length from the air. It captures a
//     generous fixed run and the host trims - which is exactly what the
//     decode-off-device architecture wants anyway.
